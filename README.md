## Project Description
 Using node.js, inquirer, and jest.js, this project generates a functional and responsive team HTML for a team manger. It includes prompts for things like name, id, email, github, school, type of employee, phone number. The questions are different based on which type of employee is being added. This project has separate test files to ensure functionality. 

## Installation
Open package.json and "Open in Integrated Terminal" from the list of options. Type "npm install" to install inquirer and bootstrap. NOTE: Node must also be installed. Then open "index.js" in your integrated terminal. You will then see questions prompted in your terminal. 

## Usage
As a manager, team lead, or someone responsible for creating/managing team contact information.

## Test Instructions
Open package.json in your integrated terminal and then type in npm install jest -D. Then right click on the test files under __test__ and type "npm run test" in your integrated terminal. You must have npm and Node installed.
